## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This challenge reiterated the concept of positioning items to the top of a container using ```position: absolute; top: 0;``` on the respective image and then ```position: relative``` on the container that you would like the image to be relative to.


### Continued development

I plan to keep using css variables and css pseudoelements as much as possible in order to gain more familiarity in addition to its usage and good practices when using it.

### Useful resources

- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the guide to all the css properties with an indept explanation. Definitely recommend it.
