I plan to keep using css variables and css pseudoelements as much as possible in order to gain more familiarity with it.

### Useful resources

- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the guide to all the css properties with an indept explanation. Definitely recommend it.
